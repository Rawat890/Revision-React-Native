100 React Native Technical Practice Questions
Document 
I've created 100 comprehensive React Native questions that focus on practical implementation and will help you build strong logical thinking skills. Each question is designed to be hands-on and actionable, similar to your example of "Display the list of elements of array using useState and the list must be scrollable."

The questions are organized into categories:

State Management - Core React hooks and Redux Toolkit
Navigation - Screen management and routing
API Integration - Data fetching and synchronization
Custom Components - Building reusable UI elements
Performance - Optimization techniques
Animations - Smooth user interactions
Storage - Data persistence strategies
Testing - Quality assurance approaches
Advanced Features - Complex integrations
Each question encourages you to:

Think through the problem logically
Implement practical solutions
Handle edge cases and error scenarios
Consider user experience aspects
Apply best practices
Start with the simpler state management questions and gradually work your way up to the more complex Redux Toolkit and advanced feature questions. This progressive approach will help you build confidence and deepen your understanding of React Native concepts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific category or provide detailed implementation guidance for particular questions?

same for the javascript as well

100 JavaScript Technical Implementation Questions
Document 
I've created 100 technical JavaScript questions that follow the exact format you requested - each question asks you to implement a specific functionality using particular JavaScript methods or concepts.

Key Features of These Questions:

Specific Implementation Focus - Each question targets a particular JavaScript method or concept (like your example with reduce)
Action-Oriented - Every question starts with "Write a function to..." or "Create a function that..." requiring hands-on coding
Method-Specific Learning - Questions are designed to help you master specific JavaScript methods:
Array methods (reduce, map, filter, find, etc.)
Object methods (Object.keys(), Object.values(), etc.)
String methods (split(), join(), substring(), etc.)
DOM methods (appendChild(), getElementById(), etc.)
Progressive Complexity - Starts with basic array operations and builds up to advanced concepts like async programming and DOM manipulation
Practical Application - Each question solves a real coding scenario you'd encounter in development
How to Use These Questions:

Pick a question and try to solve it without looking up the syntax first
After attempting, research the specific method if needed
Write complete, working code with proper error handling
Test your solution with different inputs
Move to the next question once you understand the concept
Example of the Format (like your reduce example):

Question 1: "Write a function to find sum of 10 numbers using reduce method"
Question 23: "Implement a function using substring() to extract first 5 characters from a string"
Question 47: "Wri

Follow Best Practices: Use meaningful variable names and consistent formatting
Example Implementation Format:
javascript
// Question 1: Write a function to find sum of 10 numbers using reduce method
function sumTenNumbers(numbers) {
    // Validate input array has 10 elements
    if (!Array.isArray(numbers) || numbers.length !== 10) {
        throw new Error('Input must be array of exactly 10 numbers');
    }
    
    // Use reduce to calculate sum
    const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
        return accumulator + currentValue;
    }, 0);
    
    return sum;
}

// Test the function
const testNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
console.log(sumTenNumbers(testNumbers)); // Expected output: 55
